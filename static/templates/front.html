    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I've been programming for over 20 years. I grew up on open source, and I've been fortunate
      to work with companies friendly to open source throughout most of my career. I've collected a
      few samples of my work here.

    <h2>Racing</h2>
    <p>
      In 2011 I ventured into the sport of motorcycle road racing. I focused on amateur club racing,
      gaining experience on lightweight machines until I was able to make my professional debut on
      a Harley-Davidson XR1200 in 2013. Along the way I collected a lot of great photos and videos.
