    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>
      I've been programming for over 20 years. What began with simple BASIC games in elementary
      school evolved into online multiplayer text games in high school. Shortly I learned Linux, web
      programming, and open source software in general.

      After earning my master's degree at the end of 2004, I moved from Virginia to California.
      I spent six great years at Google, before moving to reddit for a few years.
      Now I'm working on some interesting creative experiments and exploring what the Bay Area has
      to offer as a freelancer.

    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
      I have extensive experience in the full stack of web programming,
      from operations to backend and frontend development. I've even dabbled in mobile and video
      game development in my free time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy creative projects, fresh environments and new technologies.

    <h2>Racing</h2>
    <p>
      In 2011 I ventured into the sport of motorcycle road racing. I focused on amateur club racing,
      gaining experience on lightweight machines until I was able to make my professional debut on
      a Harley-Davidson XR1200 in 2013. Along the way I collected a lot of great photos and videos.
